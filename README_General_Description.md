#General Description

Ponche Toolkit is a 2D/3D library created around SharpDX (DirectX wrapper for C#) that eases the pain of programming C++ to fasten the creation of games.

###It has a Core implementation that manages the game cycle (Game loop):
 - Instantiating elements
 - Loading content as textures or models
 - Updating the cycle (30 fps/60 fps)
 - Rendering
 - Disposing elements (Managing of memory)

###It implements different modules that can work independently:
 - Physics (BEPUPhysics)
 - Custom Graphics Pipeline (HLSL integrated)
 - 2D Spritesheet Animation
 - 3D Skeletal/Spine Animation imported from Maya, 3dsMax, Blender

###Future additions:
 - After completing the basic functionality, a Windows Desktop application will be created to manipulate the creation of games in a graphical way.
 - It will be implementd as a Unity kind of program.
